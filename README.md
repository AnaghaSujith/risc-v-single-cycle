# risc-v-single-cycle
This project implements a synthesizable single-cycle RISC-V processor that supports a subset of RV32I instructions (R-type, I-type, and S-type). Designed entirely in Verilog, the processor executes one instruction per clock cycle and includes modules for instruction memory, data memory, register file, ALU, and control logic.
